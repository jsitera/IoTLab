IoT clock
=========
An IoT artefact for learning, dissemination and playing with IoT - Arduino or ESP8266 and some interesting sensors and actors.
First prototype is a circle of 60 WS2812 RGB LEDs connected via breadboard with Arduino, RTC module and anything more (sensors).

First steps
-----------
1. Download the source code: git clone https://github.com/jsitera/IoTLab.git
2. Take the IoT clock, connect Arduino IDE with cable, make all the wiring on breadboard (see source code for comments), download libraries (FastLED, RTClib) via library manager.
3. Compile and upload the basic clock code (.ino file), test it.
4. Use the example code as a template for your modification or create a new project. Good start are also FastLED library examples and docs.
